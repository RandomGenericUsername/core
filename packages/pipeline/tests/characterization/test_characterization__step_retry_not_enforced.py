"""Characterization test: Step-level retries property exists but is NOT enforced.

Evidence Anchors:
- PipelineStep.retries property: pipeline/src/task_pipeline/core/types.py:119-122
- TaskExecutor.execute: pipeline/src/task_pipeline/executors/task_executor.py:27-28
- No retry logic in TaskExecutor

Current Behavior:
- PipelineStep has a `retries` property that defaults to 0
- Subclasses can override this property to return a retry count
- However, TaskExecutor.execute() does NOT implement retry logic
- If step.run() raises an exception, it's caught and stored in context.errors
- The step is NOT retried, regardless of the retries property value

TODO: Decide if step-level retry should be implemented or if the property
should be removed/deprecated.
